### Data Architecture

HelloFresh employs a **data mesh** approach to manage customer data efficiently, treating it as a product while enabling decentralized data ownership. This model improves data scalability and value in dynamic business environments. Four core principles define this architecture: decentralized data ownership, data as a product, self-service data infrastructure, and federated data governance.

*Fig 9. HelloFresh Architecture.*

#### **Apache Kafka: Real-Time Data Streaming**
Apache Kafka is the backbone of this architecture, providing a **real-time, reliable, and scalable** infrastructure for data streaming. Kafka Connect acts as a bridge between data sources and sinks, facilitating the flow of data across multiple nodes using JSON configurations. Kafka’s open-source connectors, available on Confluent Hub, support a range of external systems to integrate seamlessly with the data mesh architecture.

#### **Data Flow and Processing**

The architecture, illustrated in Figure 9, shows how different technologies interact:

- **Debezium MySQL Source Connector** streams data from a MySQL database into the Kafka cluster. It captures database changes such as inserts, updates, and deletes, and publishes them to Kafka topics. This processed data can be piped to downstream applications like **real-time analytics (Grafana, Prometheus)** or stored in an **S3 data lake** for offline analysis.

- **Config files** and **endpoint files** work with a **data ingestion gateway** and **vault** to secure and control access to data. The config file outlines parameters for data ingestion, including source locations and data transformation rules. The vault securely stores credentials required for accessing data, ensuring only authorized applications can interact with sensitive information.

#### **ETL Orchestration with Kubernetes and Apache Airflow**
Kubernetes and Apache Airflow form a dynamic duo in automating the ETL process. Kubernetes ensures the **scaling, deployment, and management** of containerized applications, while Airflow orchestrates task execution and workflow dependencies. Together, they enable reliable **ETL (extract, transform, load)** jobs and data cleanup routines.

- **Kubernetes** runs the ETL jobs, managing resources dynamically, while **Airflow** controls the execution order and scheduling of tasks such as **data quality checks** and **metadata updates**.

- Airflow uses a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** to model complex data flows, ensuring that every step of the data pipeline is completed in the correct order. Additionally, **snapshots** are created to back up data at specific points in time, enabling robust recovery.

#### **Data Management with Apache Hive and Impala**
Data management and analysis tasks involve syncing **metastores** and **refreshing Impala**, ensuring up-to-date metadata for querying. Metastores store the metadata for datasets, while **Apache Impala** enables SQL querying and complex data analysis tasks, such as aggregations and joins.

The **data pipeline** includes:

- **EMR (Elastic MapReduce):** Manages compute nodes for large-scale data processing.
- **Glue Data Catalog:** Stores metadata and schema information, which are essential for lineage tracking and efficient querying.
- **Apache Hive Metastore:** Manages metadata for tables, enabling efficient data queries.

#### **Data Storage and Transfer via S3**
The **S3 sink connector** transfers data between **high-security raw event buckets** and an **S3 data lake**, facilitating the secure transfer and storage of raw event data. The data lake is optimized using a columnar format (e.g., Apache Parquet) for efficient querying and analysis, supported by EMR for executing big data workloads.

#### **Data Quality and Validation**
Data quality is paramount, and HelloFresh employs **Apache Spark**, **SODA**, and EMR to check for missing values, inconsistencies, and errors. These checks generate quality metrics, which are stored in **S3 buckets** for ongoing monitoring. This ensures that the data pipeline remains robust and delivers high-quality insights over time.
